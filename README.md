# flashtalking
This repository is my submission for the Mediaocean-Flashtalking Software Engineer assignment. It includes solutions to implementation exercises such as concurrent HTTP requests with timeouts, a HashMap-backed cache with optional TTL, and an extended FizzBuzz. Built with Java, it demonstrates efficient design, concurrency, and error handling.
